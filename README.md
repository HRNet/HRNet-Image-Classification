# High-resolution networks (HRNets) for Image classification

## News

- [2021/01/20] Add some stronger ImageNet pretrained models, e.g., the HRNet_W48_C_ssld_pretrained.pth achieved top-1 acc 83.6%.

- [2020/03/13] Our paper is accepted by TPAMI: [Deep High-Resolution Representation Learning for Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.07919.pdf).

- Per request, we provide two small HRNet models. #parameters and GFLOPs are similar to ResNet18. The segmentation resutls using the two small models are also available at https://github.com/HRNet/HRNet-Semantic-Segmentation.

- TensoFlow implemenation available at https://github.com/yuanyuanli85/tf-hrnet. Thanks [VictorLi](https://github.com/yuanyuanli85)!

- ONNX export enabled after fixing issues. Thanks [Baowen Bao](https://github.com/BowenBao)!

## Introduction
This is the official code of [high-resolution representations for ImageNet classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04514). 
We augment the HRNet with a classification head shown in the figure below. First, the four-resolution feature maps are fed into a bottleneck and the number of output channels are increased to 128, 256, 512, and 1024, respectively. Then, we downsample the high-resolution representations by a 2-strided 3x3 convolution outputting 256 channels and add them to the representations of the second-high-resolution representations. This process is repeated two times to get 1024 channels over the small resolution. Last, we transform 1024 channels to 2048 channels through a 1x1 convolution, followed by a global average pooling operation. The output 2048-dimensional representation is fed into the classifier.
